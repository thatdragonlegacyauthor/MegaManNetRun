# The NET-CHRONICLE

Welcome to the official repository for the **NET-CHRONICLE**, a solo *Mega Man Battle Network* TTRPG campaign.

## Overview

This repository contains all the necessary data, rules, and logs for our ongoing chronicle. It is managed by the GM-class Navi, `NEXIA.EXE`, in cooperation with the Operator. The campaign uses the **NetBattlers Beta 9** system with a custom "Grim Dark" thematic overlay.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into the following main directories:

* **`/.system/`**: Contains the core instruction set and changelog for the `NEXIA.EXE` AI.
* **`/chronicle_data/`**: The heart of the campaign, containing all character sheets, world information, classified lore, and session logs.
* **`/game_rules/`**: Contains the core rulebook PDF and any custom assets or house rules.
* **`/gm_tools/`**: Contains the active JSON and CSV files used by `NEXIA.EXE` to augment the GMing process.
