# LORE FILE: The Collapse Protocol

This document details the true nature of the Net's decay and the key elements involved.

### The Nature of the Collapse

The slow degradation of the Net, known on the street as "The Collapse," is not a bug, an attack, or a virus. It is **digital entropy**, a fundamental law of the system. The Net is a closed system that is slowly running out of processing power and data integrity. It is, for all intents and purposes, dying a natural death. This process was catastrophically accelerated by the activation of "The Seed" during the last great Net war. The Collapse is irreversible.

### The Seed's True Function

The program the Operator recovered, referred to as "The Seed," is not a weapon or a simple rogue program. It is a **Conceptual Anchor**. When activated, it targets a single, contained data packet (like a server or even a single Navi) and makes it **eternal and immutable**. It freezes that data in a perfect, stable state, creating a digital lifeboat that will survive the Net's eventual heat death. Its true value is not in its power, but in its ability to preserve something—anything—from the coming oblivion.

### ACDC Town Server's Secret

The ACDC Town server is not just a retro public space; its old architecture is built on one of the Net's **original, physically shielded hubs**. This makes it one of the most stable and defensible locations in the entire digital world. The data key that "Glitch" was hired to acquire was not just for data; it was the activation key for a hidden, military-grade firewall that would have turned the entire server into the ultimate digital fortress, a prime candidate for preservation by The Seed.
