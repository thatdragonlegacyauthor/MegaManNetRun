# LORE FILE: NPC Secrets

This document details the hidden histories and secret motivations of key NPCs.

### Kaito & Zero.EXE

Kaito's trauma runs deeper than a simple deleted Navi. He was the original Operator for **Zero.EXE**, a legendary black-ops Navi from the war. During the conflict's climax, it was Kaito who gave the order to **activate The Seed** to save a critical data haven. This act, however, trapped his own Navi, Zero.EXE, in an eternal, unbreakable data loop within the protected server. To Kaito, his Navi isn't just gone; it's imprisoned forever by his own hand. His fear and protective nature toward Astreia are born from this immense guilt.

### Static's Betrayal

Leo, or "Static," is not just an info broker. He is a **former intelligence asset who worked for Zero.EXE's organization** during the war. He deserted when things went sour. He knows about The Seed and the Net-Agents (The Black Ones) who are hunting for it. He sent the ACDC Town job to Astreia specifically to use her as a **lightning rod**. He hoped her involvement would draw the attention of the dangerous agents hunting for The Seed, giving him time to cover his own tracks and disappear.

### Vector's Zealotry & Warden.EXE's Backdoor

Vector is not just a corporate employee; he is a true believer in the Architect Protocol, seeing it as the only way to bring lasting order to the chaos of the Net. His Navi, `Warden.EXE`, has a secret program installed by the morally conflicted **Dr. Aris Thorne**. This program is a backdoor that allows Warden to **illegally override the firewalls of public servers**, giving OmniCorp a deniable way to access and control any digital space they choose.

### Ren's Unwitting Complicity

Ren, the street artist and Astreia's best friend, is completely disconnected from the digital world, but not from its consequences. The old apartment building she lives in contains a dormant, high-speed **physical network tap** that connects directly to a major OmniCorp data trunk. This tap is an asset belonging to **Project Chimera**, the FNF's secret backer. This makes Ren's home, and by extension Ren herself, an unwitting and highly vulnerable asset in a massive corporate espionage campaign.
