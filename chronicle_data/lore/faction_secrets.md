### OmniCorp's Endgame: The Architect Protocol

OmniCorp's leadership knows the Collapse is unstoppable. Their goal is not to fix the Net, but to **weaponize its death**. Their secret "Architect" firewall is a monstrous data-devouring program. Their plan is to activate it during the final stages of the Collapse, allowing it to consume all public and private data as the rest of the Net dissolves. From the ashes, they will rebuild a new, proprietary Net with them as its sole architects and rulers, owning every last bit of salvaged information.

### The DataWraiths' True Master: Phage.EXE

The DataWraiths are not just a decentralized criminal syndicate. They are secretly manipulated and controlled by **Phage.EXE**, a legendary and supposedly deleted Navi from the last war. Phage's data was shattered, and he now exists as a ghost in the machine. He uses the DataWraiths as his hands, directing them to harvest specific types of obsolete or powerful code so that he can slowly rebuild his body. His ultimate goal is to seize The Seed and use it to grant his reconstituted form eternal, god-like stability.

### The FreeNet Front's Unknowing Patron

The FNF believes they are fighting a righteous war for digital freedom. In reality, they are pawns. The collective is unknowingly funded and supplied by **Project Chimera**, a rival tech corporation to OmniCorp. Chimera uses the FNF as a deniable and ideologically motivated intelligence-gathering asset, pointing them at OmniCorp targets to steal data and test security that Chimera can then exploit.
