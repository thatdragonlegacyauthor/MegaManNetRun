## Log Entry 01

The rain against the synth-glass is a persistent hiss. The Denki District's neon glow is muted and distorted through the water-streaked pane. Inside, the only light is the cold, purple aura of the terrarium and the blinking cursor on your PET. The message from Static feels like an artifact from another time, before the world was fully built. But the job, the rival, and the risk remain.

`> ...U in?`

StarGirlâ€™s icon flickers with impatience. "The clock is ticking, Astreia. Glitch isn't going to wait for us to get comfortable. What's the call?"

## Player Decision Point

The choice is the same, but the world holding its breath around you is now fully realized. The consequences are real.

1.  **Jack in immediately.**
2.  **Do some quick research on 'Glitch'.** (A Brains check using your Talent: Signal Sweep)
3.  **Program a countermeasure.** (A Programming check)
