# FACTIONS of the NET-CHRONICLE

This document provides a public overview of the major factions and groups operating in the Denki District and on the Net.

---

## OmniCorp (The Corporate Giant)

* **Who They Are:** The ubiquitous, monolithic tech corporation. They manufacture the vast majority of PETs, sponsor the official NetBattling leagues, and own and operate the clean, commercial sectors of the Net.
* **Base of Operations:** Their gleaming, sterile corporate tower looms over the Denki District. Digitally, they are the administrators of most official servers.
* **Goals & Methods:** Publicly, their goal is to create a "safer, more efficient" digital world through proprietary software and aggressive marketing. They often hire freelance NetOps for plausibly deniable "cleanup" jobs that fall outside their public image.

## DataWraiths (The Criminal Syndicate)

* **Who They Are:** A decentralized syndicate of high-level cybercriminals. They are the digital mafia, specializing in data theft, ransomware, and trafficking in illegal BattleChips and weaponized viruses.
* **Base of Operations:** They have no physical headquarters. Their digital turf is the **Junc-Heap**, which they use as a marketplace, a hideout, and a recruitment ground.
* **Goals & Methods:** Their only goal is profit and power. They exploit chaos for financial gain and are known for their brutal efficiency. Many aspiring street operators look to them for powerful, illegal gear.

## The FreeNet Front - FNF (The Hacktivist Collective)

* **Who They Are:** A loose, ideological collective of hacktivists, programmers, and digital anarchists who believe the Net should remain an open and unregulated space for everyone. They see OmniCorp as the ultimate enemy.
* **Base of Operations:** The FNF is scattered, organizing in encrypted chat rooms and meeting in the back rooms of the Denki District's Net-Cafes.
* **Goals & Methods:** They aim to liberate information by leaking corporate documents and creating open-source alternatives to proprietary software. They are digital freedom fighters, but their methods can be chaotic and disruptive.
