## The Denki District (Physical World)

On the rain-slicked coast of a sprawling, near-future metropolis, the **Denki District** is a ward that never truly sleeps. It's a compressed maze of old and new, where centuries-old brickwork is covered in holographic graffiti and crisscrossed by thick bundles of fiber-optic cables that snake between buildings like overgrown ivy. 

By day, it's a bustling market for custom PET parts, bootleg software, and rare, imported electronics. By night, the district's true heart beats. The glow of neon signs from noodle shops and Net-Cafes paints the streets in shades of magenta and cyan. The air thrums with the bass leaking from underground music venues and the constant hum of high-powered servers. This is the haven of the city's counter-culture: NetOps, programmers, musicians, and info brokers.

## ACDC Town Square Server (Digital Space)

A classic. One of the foundational public servers from the early days of the Net, ACDC Town is the digital equivalent of a well-maintained public park. Its public-facing areas are bright, clean, and built with a charmingly retro, blocky aesthetic. Itâ€™s a nostalgic tourist spot and a safe meeting ground for official business. 

However, the server's public facade hides the **Maintenance Corridors** that exist "behind the walls." These are sterile, white-and-grey areas filled with glowing data conduits, security programs (SecProgs), and forgotten, archived data logs from a bygone era of the Net.

## The Junk-Heap (Digital Space)

If ACDC is a public park, the Junk-Heap is the city's condemned, sprawling scrapyard. It isn't a place you can just log into; you need specific coordinates, often traded in secret, and a powerful firewall to survive. The Junk-Heap is a chaotic, glitching server built from the discarded code and broken data of countless other systems. Navigating it means traversing landscapes of corrupted pixels, dodging aggressive pop-up ad viruses, and bartering with rogue Navis in hidden black markets for illegal BattleChips and cracked software. It is a lawless, dangerous place, but it's also the best place to find rare data or a Navi who needs to disappear.
