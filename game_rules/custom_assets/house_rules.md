# NET-CHRONICLE House Rules

This document contains all official modifications, additions, or clarifications to the core `NetBattlers Beta 9` rulebook for this chronicle.

---

## 1. Solo Play Bond Mechanic

* **Rule:** For this solo campaign, the "Starting Bond" mechanic (Page 21) is applied to a designated Hero NPC (Static) instead of another player character.
* **Reasoning:** This adaptation allows the Bond system to be utilized in a one-on-one game, adding mechanical weight and narrative depth to a key NPC relationship.

## 2. Custom Asset Creation

* **Rule:** The Operator and `NEXIA.EXE` may collaboratively design and implement new, custom assets, including but not limited to BattleChips, NaviCust Programs, and Viruses.
* **Reasoning:** All custom assets will be balanced against existing items in the core rulebook by `ForgeGirl.EXE` and `Systema.EXE`. Approved assets will be added to the relevant custom asset files in the repository.

## 3. [Placeholder for Future Rules]

* This section will be updated as new rulings or modifications are made during gameplay.
